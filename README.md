# Sudoku-Implementation
Searching algorithms are used to solve problems from simple to more complex problems. Time and space is an important element to decide which algorithm is designated to solve a specific problem. There are various searching algorithms for solving problems. In this assignment we tried to show five searching algorithms to solve the Sudoku problem. The Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, Backtracking search, Heuristic search and A* search.
